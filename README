This is a quick script add-on for Xcode that lets you autogenrate .gitignore and .gitattributes in the directory of your choosing.

Simple copy-paste the script into the script menu in Xcode:  Script Menu> Edit User Scripts...  (its the AppleScripting menu icon next to help )

Once you have created a new script and pasted the contents in you may just run the script and it will ask you to name and choose location for two files.
The default names are already filled in ( .gitignore , .gitattributes ) - just choose the root directory where you want them to appear.
The finder will warn you that "." will dissapear from finder view when created just hit ok!
